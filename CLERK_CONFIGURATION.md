3. Enable "Username" as a required field
4. Go to "Social Connections"
5. Disable all social providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
6. Save your changes

## What's Been Updated

1. **Removed social buttons styling** from the ClerkProvider
2. **Created clerk-config.js** to disable social providers
3. **Updated sign-in and sign-up pages** to use username/password only
4. **Removed demo credentials** from the UI (now stored in .env)
5. **Added proper redirect URLs** for better user experience

## Testing

After making these changes:

1. Restart your development server
2. Visit `/sign-in` - you should only see username/password fields
3. Visit `/sign-up` - you should only see username/email/password fields
4. No Google or other social login buttons should appear

## Security Notes

- Keep your demo credentials in the `.env.local` file only
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Use strong passwords for demo accounts
- Consider implementing rate limiting for login attempts
